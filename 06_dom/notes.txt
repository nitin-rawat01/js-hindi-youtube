 DOM: Document Object Model, document-html made from object(head, body etc. ) 
    dom -> structure of page.
window object: represent the current window
document object: represent the document/html
    
Browser console
    : console.log(window); 
        // window: is object(complex object): contain document object.
    to access document object 
        //console.log(window.document);
        console.log(document); //same result
    to access document property 
        //console.dir(document);

document ka object kis model pe bna hua hai -> understand from diagram

About html document
    <!Doctype html>-> tell browser that page is html page(especially html 5);
    page start from <html lang="en">

node: every thing in document object model is called a node: head , body , text are node.

what is the need to understand the model?
ans. to know which object has how many child and siblings and how to reach them.

//on browser console
    console.log(document); // to get document 
    console.log(document.baseURI); //URI of page
    console.log(document.links); // all links of the document // receive html collection 
    console.log(document.links[2]); //receive second link

// getting element by id: document.getElementById('firstHeading')
// editing the element : document.getElementById('firstHeading').innerHTML = "<h1>Chai aur Code</h1>"
