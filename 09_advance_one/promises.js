// everything in javascript is an object reference/ prototype ref.

// Asynchronous operations
// : file ascess
// : some calculation on data
// : crptography (password encryption)
// : network call
// : mobile dev(camera, microphone access).

// promise: operation completed in future.

// The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

// A Promise is in one of these states:

//     pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
//     fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
//     rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
